WonderPush Web SDK plugin to automatically present the user a prompt for push permission with a configurable trigger.

The browser push permission prompt will be shown without any previous message.

You should probably prefer using the [optin-dialog](https://github.com/wonderpush/wonderpush-webplugin-optin-dialog)
plugin instead of this one.

Note that this plugin may not work properly if the user is not browsing directly on your own custom domain.
